# Sawyer's EditorConfig

This builds off the `dotnet new editorconfig` to contain changes subject
to my preferences.

## Features

1. Most notably, member naming conventions are upgraded from suggestions to
warnings.
2. `var` is replaced with explicit types, and
`csharp_style_implicit_object_creation_when_type_is_apparent` is set to true.
3. A few other styles are tweaked.
